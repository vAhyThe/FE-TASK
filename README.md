# FE-TASK: AI-Powered Chat Application

## Overview
This is a modern, responsive Vue 3 chat application with AI-like interaction capabilities. The application provides a seamless chat experience with dynamic sidebar management, message handling, and a clean, intuitive user interface.

## Key Features
- AI-simulated chat responses
- Dynamic chat creation and management
- Sidebar with chat history
- Responsive design
- Performance-optimized Vue 3 implementation

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue 3
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **Routing**: Vue Router
- **Styling**: SCSS, Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Architectural Highlights
### Component Structure
- `ChatView.vue`: Main view managing chat interactions
- `ChatInput.vue`: Dedicated component for message input
- `ChatBlock.vue`: Renders chat messages
- `ChatSideBar.vue`: Manages chat list and interactions

### State Management
Utilizes Pinia for centralized state management, with a `chatStore` handling:
- Chat creation
- Message storage
- Chat switching
- Persistent storage

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy-loaded components
- Minimal re-renders using Vue 3's reactivity system
- Efficient state management with Pinia
